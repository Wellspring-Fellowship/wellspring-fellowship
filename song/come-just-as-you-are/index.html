    <p>You who are troubled and burdened by sin,<br />
 Come just as you are;<br />
Come to the Savior, a new life begin,<br />
 Oh, come just as you are.</p>

<p>Refrain:<br />
Come just as you are,<br />
Oh, come just as you are;<br />
Turn from your sin, let the Savior come in,<br />
And come just as you are.</p>

<p>Deep in your heart sin has written its scar,<br />
Come just as you are;<br />
Though from your Father youâ€™ve wandered afar,<br />
Oh, come just as you are.</p>

<p>Refrain:<br />
Come just as you are,<br />
Oh, come just as you are;<br />
Turn from your sin, let the Savior come in,<br />
And come just as you are.</p>

<p>Sinful and guilty, heart broken and lost,<br />
Come just as you are;<br />
Think what your ransom on Calvary cost!<br />
Oh, come just as you are.</p>

<p>Refrain:<br />
Come just as you are,<br />
Oh, come just as you are;<br />
Turn from your sin, let the Savior come in,<br />
And come just as you are.</p>

<p>Naught with your goodness for sin can atone,<br />
Come just as you are;<br />
Trust in the merit of Jesus alone,<br />
And come just as you are.</p>

<p>Refrain:<br />
Come just as you are,<br />
Oh, come just as you are;<br />
Turn from your sin, let the Savior come in,<br />
And come just as you are.</p>

<p>Come with your heartaches, your sorrow and pain,<br />
Come just as you are;<br />
No one has come to the Savior in vain,<br />
Oh, come just as you are.</p>

<p>Refrain:<br />
Come just as you are,<br />
Oh, come just as you are;<br />
Turn from your sin, let the Savior come in,<br />
And come just as you are.</p>
