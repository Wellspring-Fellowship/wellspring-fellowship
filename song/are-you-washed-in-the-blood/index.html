    <p>Have you been to Jesus for the cleansing power?<br />
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?<br />
Are you fully trusting in His grace this hour?<br />
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?</p>

<p>Refrain:<br />
Are you washed in the blood,<br />
In the soul cleansing blood of the Lamb?<br />
Are your garments spotless? Are they white as snow?<br />
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?</p>

<p>Are you walking daily by the Savior’s side?<br />
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?<br />
Do you rest each moment in the Crucified?<br />
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?</p>

<p>Refrain:<br />
Are you washed in the blood,<br />
In the soul cleansing blood of the Lamb?<br />
Are your garments spotless? Are they white as snow?<br />
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?</p>

<p>When the Bridegroom cometh will your robes be white?<br />
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?<br />
Will your soul be ready for the mansions bright,<br />
And be washed in the blood of the Lamb?</p>

<p>Refrain:<br />
Are you washed in the blood,<br />
In the soul cleansing blood of the Lamb?<br />
Are your garments spotless? Are they white as snow?<br />
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?</p>

<p>Lay aside the garments that are stained with sin,<br />
And be washed in the blood of the Lamb;<br />
There’s a fountain flowing for the soul unclean,<br />
O be washed in the blood of the Lamb!</p>

<p>Refrain:<br />
Are you washed in the blood,<br />
In the soul cleansing blood of the Lamb?<br />
Are your garments spotless? Are they white as snow?<br />
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?</p>
