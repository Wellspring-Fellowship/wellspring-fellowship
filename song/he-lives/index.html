    <p>I serve a risen Savior, He’s in the world today;<br />
I know that He is living, whatever men may say;<br />
I see His hand of mercy, I hear His voice of cheer,<br />
And just the time I need Him, He’s always near.</p>

<p>Refrain:<br />
He lives, He lives, Christ Jesus lives today!<br />
He walks with me and talks with me, along life’s narrow way.<br />
He lives, He lives, salvation to impart!<br />
You ask me how I know He lives?<br />
He gave me a new heart.</p>

<p>In all the world around me I see His loving care,<br />
And though my heart grows weary I never will despair;<br />
I know that He is leading though all the stormy blast,<br />
The day of His appearing will come at last.</p>

<p>Refrain:<br />
He lives, He lives, Christ Jesus lives today!<br />
He walks with me and talks with me, along life’s narrow way.<br />
He lives, He lives, salvation to impart!<br />
You ask me how I know He lives?<br />
He gave me a new heart.</p>

<p>Rejoice, rejoice O Christian, lift up your voice and sing,<br />
Eternal hallelujahs to Jesus Christ the King!<br />
The hope of all who seek Him, the Help of all who find,<br />
None other is so loving, so good and kind.</p>

<p>Refrain:<br />
He lives, He lives, Christ Jesus lives today!<br />
He walks with me and talks with me, along life’s narrow way.<br />
He lives, He lives, salvation to impart!<br />
You ask me how I know He lives?<br />
He gave me a new heart.</p>
