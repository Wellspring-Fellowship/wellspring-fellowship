    <p>When upon life’s billows you are tempest tossed,<br />
When you are discouraged, thinking all is lost,<br />
Count your many blessings, name them one by one,<br />
And it will surprise you what the Lord hath done.</p>

<p>Refrain:<br />
Count your blessings, name them one by one,<br />
Count your blessings, see what God hath done!<br />
Count your blessings, name them one by one,<br />
And it will surprise you what the Lord hath done.</p>

<p>Are you ever burdened with a load of care?<br />
Does the cross seem heavy you are called to bear?<br />
Count your many blessings, every doubt will fly,<br />
And you will keep singing as the days go by.</p>

<p>Refrain:<br />
Count your blessings, name them one by one,<br />
Count your blessings, see what God hath done!<br />
Count your blessings, name them one by one,<br />
And it will surprise you what the Lord hath done.</p>

<p>When you look at others with their lands and gold,<br />
Think that Christ has promised you His wealth untold;<br />
Count your many blessings. Money can not buy<br />
Your reward in heaven, nor your home on high.</p>

<p>Refrain:<br />
Count your blessings, name them one by one,<br />
Count your blessings, see what God hath done!<br />
Count your blessings, name them one by one,<br />
And it will surprise you what the Lord hath done.</p>

<p>So, amid the conflict whether great or small,<br />
Do not be discouraged, God is over all;<br />
Count your many blessings, angels will attend,<br />
Help and comfort give you to your journey’s end.</p>

<p>Refrain:<br />
Count your blessings, name them one by one,<br />
Count your blessings, see what God hath done!<br />
Count your blessings, name them one by one,<br />
And it will surprise you what the Lord hath done.</p>
