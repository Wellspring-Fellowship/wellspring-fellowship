    <p>I will sing of my Redeemer,<br />
And His wondrous love to me;<br />
On the cruel cross He suffered,<br />
From the curse to set me free.</p>

<p>Refrain:<br />
Sing, oh sing, of my Redeemer,<br />
With His blood, He purchased me.<br />
On the cross, He sealed my pardon,<br />
Paid the debt, and made me free.</p>

<p>I will tell the wondrous story,<br />
How my lost estate to save,<br />
In His boundless love and mercy,<br />
He the ransom freely gave.</p>

<p>Refrain:<br />
Sing, oh sing, of my Redeemer,<br />
With His blood, He purchased me.<br />
On the cross, He sealed my pardon,<br />
Paid the debt, and made me free.</p>

<p>I will praise my dear Redeemer,<br />
His triumphant power I’ll tell,<br />
How the victory He giveth<br />
Over sin, and death, and hell.</p>

<p>Refrain:<br />
Sing, oh sing, of my Redeemer,<br />
With His blood, He purchased me.<br />
On the cross, He sealed my pardon,<br />
Paid the debt, and made me free.</p>

<p>I will sing of my Redeemer,<br />
And His heav’nly love to me;<br />
He from death to life hath brought me,<br />
Son of God with Him to be.</p>

<p>Refrain:<br />
Sing, oh sing, of my Redeemer,<br />
With His blood, He purchased me.<br />
On the cross, He sealed my pardon,<br />
Paid the debt, and made me free.</p>
