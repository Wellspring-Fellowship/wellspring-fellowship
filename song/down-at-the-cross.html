    <p>Down at the cross where my Savior died,
Down where for cleansing from sin I cried,
There to my heart was the blood applied;
Glory to His name!</p>

<p>Refrain:
Glory to His name, glory to His name:
There to my heart was the blood applied;
Glory to His name!</p>

<p>I am so wondrously saved from sin,
Jesus so sweetly abides within;
There at the cross where He took me in;
Glory to His name!</p>

<p>Refrain:
Glory to His name, glory to His name:
There to my heart was the blood applied;
Glory to His name!</p>

<p>Oh, precious fountain that saves from sin,
I am so glad I have entered in;
There Jesus saves me and keeps me clean;
Glory to His name!</p>

<p>Refrain:
Glory to His name, glory to His name:
There to my heart was the blood applied;
Glory to His name!</p>

<p>Come to this fountain so rich and sweet,
Cast thy poor soul at the Saviorâ€™s feet;
Plunge in today, and be made complete;
Glory to His name!</p>

<p>Refrain:
Glory to His name, glory to His name:
There to my heart was the blood applied;
Glory to His name!</p>
