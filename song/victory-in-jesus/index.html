  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I heard an old, old story,<br />
How a Savior came from glory,<br />
How He gave His life on Calvary<br />
To save a wretch like me;<br />
I heard about His groaning,<br />
Of His precious blood’s atoning,<br />
Then I repented of my sins<br />
And won the victory.</p>

<p>Chorus:<br />
O victory in Jesus,<br />
My Savior, forever.<br />
He sought me and bought me<br />
With His redeeming blood;<br />
He loved me ere I knew Him<br />
And all my love is due Him,<br />
He plunged me to victory,<br />
Beneath the cleansing flood.</p>

<p>I heard about His healing,<br />
Of His cleansing pow’r revealing.<br />
How He made the lame to walk again<br />
And caused the blind to see;<br />
And then I cried, “Dear Jesus,<br />
Come and heal my broken spirit,”<br />
And somehow Jesus came and brought<br />
To me the victory.</p>

<p>Chorus:<br />
O victory in Jesus,<br />
My Savior, forever.<br />
He sought me and bought me<br />
With His redeeming blood;<br />
He loved me ere I knew Him<br />
And all my love is due Him,<br />
He plunged me to victory,<br />
Beneath the cleansing flood.</p>

<p>I heard about a mansion<br />
He has built for me in glory.<br />
And I heard about the streets of gold<br />
Beyond the crystal sea;<br />
About the angels singing,<br />
And the old redemption story,<br />
And some sweet day I’ll sing up there<br />
The song of victory.</p>

<p>Chorus:<br />
O victory in Jesus,<br />
My Savior, forever.<br />
He sought me and bought me<br />
With His redeeming blood;<br />
He loved me ere I knew Him<br />
And all my love is due Him,<br />
He plunged me to victory,<br />
Beneath the cleansing flood.</p>
