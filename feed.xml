        <title>COME, THOU FOUNT of EVERY BLESSING</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Come, Thou Fount of every blessing,
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;
Streams of mercy, never ceasing,
Call for songs of loudest praise.
Teach me some melodious sonnet,
Sung by flaming tongues above.
Praise the mount! I’m fixed upon it,
Mount of Thy redeeming love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorrowing I shall be in spirit,
Till released from flesh and sin,
Yet from what I do inherit,
Here Thy praises I’ll begin;
Here I raise my Ebenezer;
Here by Thy great help I’ve come;
And I hope, by Thy good pleasure,
Safely to arrive at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus sought me when a stranger,
Wandering from the fold of God;
He, to rescue me from danger,
Interposed His precious blood;
How His kindness yet pursues me
Mortal tongue can never tell,
Clothed in flesh, till death shall loose me
I cannot proclaim it well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O to grace how great a debtor
Daily I’m constrained to be!
Let Thy goodness, like a fetter,
Bind my wandering heart to Thee.
Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,
Prone to leave the God I love;
Here’s my heart, O take and seal it,
Seal it for Thy courts above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O that day when freed from sinning,
I shall see Thy lovely face;
Clothed then in blood washed linen
How I’ll sing Thy sovereign grace;
Come, my Lord, no longer tarry,
Take my ransomed soul away;
Send thine angels now to carry
Me to realms of endless day.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Wonderful Grace of Jesus</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Wonderful grace of Jesus,
Greater than all my sin;
How shall my tongue describe it,
Where shall its praise begin?
Taking away my burden,
Setting my spirit free;
For the wonderful grace of Jesus reaches me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refrain:
Wonderful the matchless grace of Jesus,
Deeper than the mighty rolling sea;
Higher than the mountains, sparkling like a fountain,
All sufficient grace for me.
Broader than the scope of my transgressions,
Greater far than all my sin and shame.
O magnify the precious Name of Jesus,
Praise His Name!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>When the roll is called up yonder</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound, and time shall be no more,
And the morning breaks, eternal, bright and fair;
When the saved of earth shall gather over on the other shore,
And the roll is called up yonder, I’ll be there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refrain:
When the roll, is called up yonder,
When the roll, is called up yonder,
When the roll, is called up yonder,
When the roll is called up yonder I’ll be there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On that bright and cloudless morning when the dead in Christ shall rise,
And the glory of His resurrection share;
When His chosen ones shall gather to their home beyond the skies,
And the roll is called up yonder, I’ll be there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refrain:
When the roll, is called up yonder,
When the roll, is called up yonder,
When the roll, is called up yonder,
When the roll is called up yonder I’ll be there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us labor for the Master from the dawn till setting sun,
Let us talk of all His wondrous love and care;
Then when all of life is over, and our work on earth is done,
And the roll is called up yonder, I’ll be there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refrain:
When the roll, is called up yonder,
When the roll, is called up yonder,
When the roll, is called up yonder,
When the roll is called up yonder I’ll be there.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What a Friend We have in Jesus</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;What a friend we have in Jesus,
All our sins and griefs to bear!
What a privilege to carry
Everything to God in prayer!
Oh, what peace we often forfeit,
Oh, what needless pain we bear,
All because we do not carry
Everything to God in prayer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have we trials and temptations?
Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be discouraged—
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Can we find a friend so faithful,
Who will all our sorrows share?
Jesus knows our every weakness;
Take it to the Lord in prayer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are we weak and heavy-laden,
Cumbered with a load of care?
Precious Savior, still our refuge—
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?
Take it to the Lord in prayer!
In His arms He’ll take and shield thee,
Thou wilt find a solace there.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>We&#39;re marching to Zion</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Come, we that love the Lord,
And let our joys be known;
Join in a song with sweet accord,
Join in a song with sweet accord
And thus surround the throne,
And thus surround the throne.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refrain:
We’re marching to Zion,
Beautiful, beautiful Zion;
We’re marching upward to Zion,
The beautiful city of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let those refuse to sing,
Who never knew our God;
But children of the heavenly King,
But children of the heavenly King
May speak their joys abroad,
May speak their joys abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refrain:
We’re marching to Zion,
Beautiful, beautiful Zion;
We’re marching upward to Zion,
The beautiful city of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hill of Zion yields
A thousand sacred sweets
Before we reach the heav’nly fields,
Before we reach the heav’nly fields,
Or walk the golden streets,
Or walk the golden streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refrain:
We’re marching to Zion,
Beautiful, beautiful Zion;
We’re marching upward to Zion,
The beautiful city of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then let our songs abound,
And every tear be dry;
We’re marching through Immanuel’s ground,
We’re marching through Immanuel’s ground,
To fairer worlds on high,
To fairer worlds on high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refrain:
We’re marching to Zion,
Beautiful, beautiful Zion;
We’re marching upward to Zion,
The beautiful city of God.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>We three Kings</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We three kings of Orient are
Bearing gifts we traverse afar.
Field and fountain, moor and mountain,
Following yonder star.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O star of wonder, star of night,
Star with royal beauty bright,
Westward leading, still proceeding,
Guide us to thy perfect Light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Born a king on Bethlehem’s plain,
Gold I bring to crown Him again,
King forever, ceasing never
Over us all to reign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O star of wonder, star of night,
Star with royal beauty bright,
Westward leading, still proceeding,
Guide us to thy perfect Light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frankincense to offer have I.
Incense owns a Deity nigh.
Prayer and praising all men raising,
Worship Him, God most high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O star of wonder, star of night,
Star with royal beauty bright,
Westward leading, still proceeding,
Guide us to thy perfect Light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Myrrh is mine: Its bitter perfume
Breaths a life of gathering gloom.
Sorrowing, sighing, bleeding dying,
Sealed in the stone-cold tomb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O star of wonder, star of night,
Star with royal beauty bright,
Westward leading, still proceeding,
Guide us to thy perfect Light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glorious now behold Him arise,
King and God and Sacrifice.
Alleluia, alleluia!
Earth to heaven replies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O star of wonder, star of night,
Star with royal beauty bright,
Westward leading, still proceeding,
Guide us to thy perfect Light&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Victory In Jesus</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I heard an old, old story,
How a Savior came from glory,
How He gave His life on Calvary
To save a wretch like me;
I heard about His groaning,
Of His precious blood’s atoning,
Then I repented of my sins
And won the victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chorus:
O victory in Jesus,
My Savior, forever.
He sought me and bought me
With His redeeming blood;
He loved me ere I knew Him
And all my love is due Him,
He plunged me to victory,
Beneath the cleansing flood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I heard about His healing,
Of His cleansing pow’r revealing.
How He made the lame to walk again
And caused the blind to see;
And then I cried, “Dear Jesus,
Come and heal my broken spirit,”
And somehow Jesus came and brought
To me the victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chorus:
O victory in Jesus,
My Savior, forever.
He sought me and bought me
With His redeeming blood;
He loved me ere I knew Him
And all my love is due Him,
He plunged me to victory,
Beneath the cleansing flood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I heard about a mansion
He has built for me in glory.
And I heard about the streets of gold
Beyond the crystal sea;
About the angels singing,
And the old redemption story,
And some sweet day I’ll sing up there
The song of victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chorus:
O victory in Jesus,
My Savior, forever.
He sought me and bought me
With His redeeming blood;
He loved me ere I knew Him
And all my love is due Him,
He plunged me to victory,
Beneath the cleansing flood.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Trust and obey</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When we walk with the Lord in the light of His Word,
What a glory He sheds on our way!
While we do His good will, He abides with us still,
And with all who will trust and obey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refrain:
Trust and obey, for there’s no other way
To be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not a burden we bear, not a sorrow we share,
But our toil He doth richly repay;
Not a grief or a loss, not a frown or a cross,
But is blessed if we trust and obey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refrain:
Trust and obey, for there’s no other way
To be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we never can prove the delights of His love
Until all on the altar we lay;
For the favor He shows, and the joy He bestows,
Are for them who will trust and obey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refrain:
Trust and obey, for there’s no other way
To be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then in fellowship sweet we will sit at His feet.
Or we’ll walk by His side in the way.
What He says we will do, where He sends we will go;
Never fear, only trust and obey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refrain:
Trust and obey, for there’s no other way
To be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>To God be the glory</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;To God be the glory, great things He hath done;
So loved He the world that He gave us His Son,
Who yielded His life an atonement for sin,
And opened the life gate that all may go in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refrain:
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Let the earth hear His voice!
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Let the people rejoice!
O come to the Father, through Jesus the Son,
And give Him the glory, great things He hath done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O perfect redemption, the purchase of blood,
To every believer the promise of God;
The vilest offender who truly believes,
That moment from Jesus a pardon receives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refrain:
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Let the earth hear His voice!
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Let the people rejoice!
O come to the Father, through Jesus the Son,
And give Him the glory, great things He hath done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great things He hath taught us, great things He hath done,
And great our rejoicing through Jesus the Son;
But purer, and higher, and greater will be
Our wonder, our victory, when Jesus we see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refrain:
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Let the earth hear His voice!
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Let the people rejoice!
O come to the Father, through Jesus the Son,
And give Him the glory, great things He hath done.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>This little light of mine</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This little light of mine, I’m gonna let it shine.
This little light of mine, I’m gonna let it shine,
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hide it under a bushel - NO!
I’m gonna let it shine,
Hide it under a bushel - NO!
I’m gonna let it shine,
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t let Satan blow it out.
I’m gonna let it shine
Don’t let Satan blow it out.
I’m gonna let it shine,
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This little light of mine, I’m gonna let it shine.
This little light of mine, I’m gonna let it shine,
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine.&lt;/p&gt;
