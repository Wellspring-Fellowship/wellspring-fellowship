        <title>Amazing Love</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m forgiven because you were forsaken
I’m accepted, You were condemned
I am alive and well, Your spirit is within me
Because You died and rose again&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazing love
How can it be?
That You, my King would die for me?
Amazing love
I know it’s true
It’s my joy to honor You,
In all I do, to honor You&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m forgiven because You were forsaken
I’m accepted, You were condemned
I am alive and well, Your spirit is within me
Because You died and rose again&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazing love
How can it be?
That You, my King would die for me?
Amazing love
I know it’s true
It’s my joy to honor You,
In all I do, to honor You&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are my King,
You are my King,
Jesus You are my King
Jesus You are my King&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Lord I Lift Your Name on High</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Lord I lift Your name on high.
Lord I love to sing Your praises.
I’m so glad Your in my life.
I’m so glad You came to save us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Chorus:]
You came from heaven to earth
to show the way;
from the earth to the cross
my debt to pay.
From the cross to the grave,
from the grave to the sky,
Lord I lift Your name on high&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>And Can It Be That I Should Gain?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;And can it be that I should gain
An interest in the Savior’s blood?
Died He for me, who caused His pain-
For me, who Him to death pursued?
Amazing love! How can it be,
That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?
Amazing love! How can it be,
That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Tis mystery all: th’Immortal dies:
Who can explore His strange design?
In vain the firstborn seraph tries
To sound the depths of love divine.
‘Tis mercy all! Let earth adore,
Let angel minds inquire no more.
‘Tis mercy all! Let earth adore;
Let angel minds inquire no more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He left His Father’s throne above
So free, so infinite His grace—
Emptied Himself of all but love,
And bled for Adam’s helpless race:
‘Tis mercy all, immense and free,
For O my God, it found out me!
‘Tis mercy all, immense and free,
For O my God, it found out me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long my imprisoned spirit lay,
Fast bound in sin and nature’s night;
Thine eye diffused a quickening ray—
I woke, the dungeon flamed with light;
My chains fell off, my heart was free,
I rose, went forth, and followed Thee.
My chains fell off, my heart was free,
I rose, went forth, and followed Thee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still the small inward voice I hear,
That whispers all my sins forgiven;
Still the atoning blood is near,
That quenched the wrath of hostile Heaven.
I feel the life His wounds impart;
I feel the Savior in my heart.
I feel the life His wounds impart;
I feel the Savior in my heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No condemnation now I dread;
Jesus, and all in Him, is mine;
Alive in Him, my living Head,
And clothed in righteousness divine,
Bold I approach th’eternal throne,
And claim the crown, through Christ my own.
Bold I approach th’eternal throne,
And claim the crown through Christ my own.&lt;/p&gt;
