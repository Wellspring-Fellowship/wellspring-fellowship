        <title>Wonderful Grace of Jesus</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Wonderful grace of Jesus,&lt;br /&gt;
Greater than all my sin;&lt;br /&gt;
How shall my tongue describe it,&lt;br /&gt;
Where shall its praise begin?&lt;br /&gt;
Taking away my burden,&lt;br /&gt;
Setting my spirit free;&lt;br /&gt;
For the wonderful grace of Jesus reaches me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refrain:&lt;br /&gt;
Wonderful the matchless grace of Jesus,&lt;br /&gt;
Deeper than the mighty rolling sea;&lt;br /&gt;
Higher than the mountains, sparkling like a fountain,&lt;br /&gt;
All sufficient grace for me.&lt;br /&gt;
Broader than the scope of my transgressions,&lt;br /&gt;
Greater far than all my sin and shame.&lt;br /&gt;
O magnify the precious Name of Jesus,&lt;br /&gt;
Praise His Name!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>When the roll is called up yonder</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound, and time shall be no more,&lt;br /&gt;
And the morning breaks, eternal, bright and fair;&lt;br /&gt;
When the saved of earth shall gather over on the other shore,&lt;br /&gt;
And the roll is called up yonder, I’ll be there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refrain:&lt;br /&gt;
When the roll, is called up yonder,&lt;br /&gt;
When the roll, is called up yonder,&lt;br /&gt;
When the roll, is called up yonder,&lt;br /&gt;
When the roll is called up yonder I’ll be there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On that bright and cloudless morning when the dead in Christ shall rise,&lt;br /&gt;
And the glory of His resurrection share;&lt;br /&gt;
When His chosen ones shall gather to their home beyond the skies,&lt;br /&gt;
And the roll is called up yonder, I’ll be there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refrain:&lt;br /&gt;
When the roll, is called up yonder,&lt;br /&gt;
When the roll, is called up yonder,&lt;br /&gt;
When the roll, is called up yonder,&lt;br /&gt;
When the roll is called up yonder I’ll be there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us labor for the Master from the dawn till setting sun,&lt;br /&gt;
Let us talk of all His wondrous love and care;&lt;br /&gt;
Then when all of life is over, and our work on earth is done,&lt;br /&gt;
And the roll is called up yonder, I’ll be there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refrain:&lt;br /&gt;
When the roll, is called up yonder,&lt;br /&gt;
When the roll, is called up yonder,&lt;br /&gt;
When the roll, is called up yonder,&lt;br /&gt;
When the roll is called up yonder I’ll be there.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What a Friend We have in Jesus</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;What a friend we have in Jesus,&lt;br /&gt;
All our sins and griefs to bear!&lt;br /&gt;
What a privilege to carry&lt;br /&gt;
Everything to God in prayer!&lt;br /&gt;
Oh, what peace we often forfeit,&lt;br /&gt;
Oh, what needless pain we bear,&lt;br /&gt;
All because we do not carry&lt;br /&gt;
Everything to God in prayer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have we trials and temptations?&lt;br /&gt;
Is there trouble anywhere?&lt;br /&gt;
We should never be discouraged—&lt;br /&gt;
Take it to the Lord in prayer.&lt;br /&gt;
Can we find a friend so faithful,&lt;br /&gt;
Who will all our sorrows share?&lt;br /&gt;
Jesus knows our every weakness;&lt;br /&gt;
Take it to the Lord in prayer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are we weak and heavy-laden,&lt;br /&gt;
Cumbered with a load of care?&lt;br /&gt;
Precious Savior, still our refuge—&lt;br /&gt;
Take it to the Lord in prayer.&lt;br /&gt;
Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?&lt;br /&gt;
Take it to the Lord in prayer!&lt;br /&gt;
In His arms He’ll take and shield thee,&lt;br /&gt;
Thou wilt find a solace there.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>We&#39;re marching to Zion</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Come, we that love the Lord,&lt;br /&gt;
And let our joys be known;&lt;br /&gt;
Join in a song with sweet accord,&lt;br /&gt;
Join in a song with sweet accord&lt;br /&gt;
And thus surround the throne,&lt;br /&gt;
And thus surround the throne.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refrain:&lt;br /&gt;
We’re marching to Zion,&lt;br /&gt;
Beautiful, beautiful Zion;&lt;br /&gt;
We’re marching upward to Zion,&lt;br /&gt;
The beautiful city of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let those refuse to sing,&lt;br /&gt;
Who never knew our God;&lt;br /&gt;
But children of the heavenly King,&lt;br /&gt;
But children of the heavenly King&lt;br /&gt;
May speak their joys abroad,&lt;br /&gt;
May speak their joys abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refrain:&lt;br /&gt;
We’re marching to Zion,&lt;br /&gt;
Beautiful, beautiful Zion;&lt;br /&gt;
We’re marching upward to Zion,&lt;br /&gt;
The beautiful city of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hill of Zion yields&lt;br /&gt;
A thousand sacred sweets&lt;br /&gt;
Before we reach the heav’nly fields,&lt;br /&gt;
Before we reach the heav’nly fields,&lt;br /&gt;
Or walk the golden streets,&lt;br /&gt;
Or walk the golden streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refrain:&lt;br /&gt;
We’re marching to Zion,&lt;br /&gt;
Beautiful, beautiful Zion;&lt;br /&gt;
We’re marching upward to Zion,&lt;br /&gt;
The beautiful city of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then let our songs abound,&lt;br /&gt;
And every tear be dry;&lt;br /&gt;
We’re marching through Immanuel’s ground,&lt;br /&gt;
We’re marching through Immanuel’s ground,&lt;br /&gt;
To fairer worlds on high,&lt;br /&gt;
To fairer worlds on high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refrain:&lt;br /&gt;
We’re marching to Zion,&lt;br /&gt;
Beautiful, beautiful Zion;&lt;br /&gt;
We’re marching upward to Zion,&lt;br /&gt;
The beautiful city of God.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>We three Kings</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We three kings of Orient are&lt;br /&gt;
Bearing gifts we traverse afar.&lt;br /&gt;
Field and fountain, moor and mountain,&lt;br /&gt;
Following yonder star.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O star of wonder, star of night,&lt;br /&gt;
Star with royal beauty bright,&lt;br /&gt;
Westward leading, still proceeding,&lt;br /&gt;
Guide us to thy perfect Light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Born a king on Bethlehem’s plain,&lt;br /&gt;
Gold I bring to crown Him again,&lt;br /&gt;
King forever, ceasing never&lt;br /&gt;
Over us all to reign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O star of wonder, star of night,&lt;br /&gt;
Star with royal beauty bright,&lt;br /&gt;
Westward leading, still proceeding,&lt;br /&gt;
Guide us to thy perfect Light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frankincense to offer have I.&lt;br /&gt;
Incense owns a Deity nigh.&lt;br /&gt;
Prayer and praising all men raising,&lt;br /&gt;
Worship Him, God most high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O star of wonder, star of night,&lt;br /&gt;
Star with royal beauty bright,&lt;br /&gt;
Westward leading, still proceeding,&lt;br /&gt;
Guide us to thy perfect Light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Myrrh is mine: Its bitter perfume&lt;br /&gt;
Breaths a life of gathering gloom.&lt;br /&gt;
Sorrowing, sighing, bleeding dying,&lt;br /&gt;
Sealed in the stone-cold tomb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O star of wonder, star of night,&lt;br /&gt;
Star with royal beauty bright,&lt;br /&gt;
Westward leading, still proceeding,&lt;br /&gt;
Guide us to thy perfect Light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glorious now behold Him arise,&lt;br /&gt;
King and God and Sacrifice.&lt;br /&gt;
Alleluia, alleluia!&lt;br /&gt;
Earth to heaven replies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O star of wonder, star of night,&lt;br /&gt;
Star with royal beauty bright,&lt;br /&gt;
Westward leading, still proceeding,&lt;br /&gt;
Guide us to thy perfect Light&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Victory In Jesus</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I heard an old, old story,&lt;br /&gt;
How a Savior came from glory,&lt;br /&gt;
How He gave His life on Calvary&lt;br /&gt;
To save a wretch like me;&lt;br /&gt;
I heard about His groaning,&lt;br /&gt;
Of His precious blood’s atoning,&lt;br /&gt;
Then I repented of my sins&lt;br /&gt;
And won the victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chorus:&lt;br /&gt;
O victory in Jesus,&lt;br /&gt;
My Savior, forever.&lt;br /&gt;
He sought me and bought me&lt;br /&gt;
With His redeeming blood;&lt;br /&gt;
He loved me ere I knew Him&lt;br /&gt;
And all my love is due Him,&lt;br /&gt;
He plunged me to victory,&lt;br /&gt;
Beneath the cleansing flood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I heard about His healing,&lt;br /&gt;
Of His cleansing pow’r revealing.&lt;br /&gt;
How He made the lame to walk again&lt;br /&gt;
And caused the blind to see;&lt;br /&gt;
And then I cried, “Dear Jesus,&lt;br /&gt;
Come and heal my broken spirit,”&lt;br /&gt;
And somehow Jesus came and brought&lt;br /&gt;
To me the victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chorus:&lt;br /&gt;
O victory in Jesus,&lt;br /&gt;
My Savior, forever.&lt;br /&gt;
He sought me and bought me&lt;br /&gt;
With His redeeming blood;&lt;br /&gt;
He loved me ere I knew Him&lt;br /&gt;
And all my love is due Him,&lt;br /&gt;
He plunged me to victory,&lt;br /&gt;
Beneath the cleansing flood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I heard about a mansion&lt;br /&gt;
He has built for me in glory.&lt;br /&gt;
And I heard about the streets of gold&lt;br /&gt;
Beyond the crystal sea;&lt;br /&gt;
About the angels singing,&lt;br /&gt;
And the old redemption story,&lt;br /&gt;
And some sweet day I’ll sing up there&lt;br /&gt;
The song of victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chorus:&lt;br /&gt;
O victory in Jesus,&lt;br /&gt;
My Savior, forever.&lt;br /&gt;
He sought me and bought me&lt;br /&gt;
With His redeeming blood;&lt;br /&gt;
He loved me ere I knew Him&lt;br /&gt;
And all my love is due Him,&lt;br /&gt;
He plunged me to victory,&lt;br /&gt;
Beneath the cleansing flood.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Trust and obey</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When we walk with the Lord in the light of His Word,&lt;br /&gt;
What a glory He sheds on our way!&lt;br /&gt;
While we do His good will, He abides with us still,&lt;br /&gt;
And with all who will trust and obey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refrain:&lt;br /&gt;
Trust and obey, for there’s no other way&lt;br /&gt;
To be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not a burden we bear, not a sorrow we share,&lt;br /&gt;
But our toil He doth richly repay;&lt;br /&gt;
Not a grief or a loss, not a frown or a cross,&lt;br /&gt;
But is blessed if we trust and obey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refrain:&lt;br /&gt;
Trust and obey, for there’s no other way&lt;br /&gt;
To be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we never can prove the delights of His love&lt;br /&gt;
Until all on the altar we lay;&lt;br /&gt;
For the favor He shows, and the joy He bestows,&lt;br /&gt;
Are for them who will trust and obey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refrain:&lt;br /&gt;
Trust and obey, for there’s no other way&lt;br /&gt;
To be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then in fellowship sweet we will sit at His feet.&lt;br /&gt;
Or we’ll walk by His side in the way.&lt;br /&gt;
What He says we will do, where He sends we will go;&lt;br /&gt;
Never fear, only trust and obey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refrain:&lt;br /&gt;
Trust and obey, for there’s no other way&lt;br /&gt;
To be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>To God be the glory</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;To God be the glory, great things He hath done;&lt;br /&gt;
So loved He the world that He gave us His Son,&lt;br /&gt;
Who yielded His life an atonement for sin,&lt;br /&gt;
And opened the life gate that all may go in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refrain:&lt;br /&gt;
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,&lt;br /&gt;
Let the earth hear His voice!&lt;br /&gt;
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,&lt;br /&gt;
Let the people rejoice!&lt;br /&gt;
O come to the Father, through Jesus the Son,&lt;br /&gt;
And give Him the glory, great things He hath done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O perfect redemption, the purchase of blood,&lt;br /&gt;
To every believer the promise of God;&lt;br /&gt;
The vilest offender who truly believes,&lt;br /&gt;
That moment from Jesus a pardon receives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refrain:&lt;br /&gt;
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,&lt;br /&gt;
Let the earth hear His voice!&lt;br /&gt;
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,&lt;br /&gt;
Let the people rejoice!&lt;br /&gt;
O come to the Father, through Jesus the Son,&lt;br /&gt;
And give Him the glory, great things He hath done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great things He hath taught us, great things He hath done,&lt;br /&gt;
And great our rejoicing through Jesus the Son;&lt;br /&gt;
But purer, and higher, and greater will be&lt;br /&gt;
Our wonder, our victory, when Jesus we see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refrain:&lt;br /&gt;
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,&lt;br /&gt;
Let the earth hear His voice!&lt;br /&gt;
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,&lt;br /&gt;
Let the people rejoice!&lt;br /&gt;
O come to the Father, through Jesus the Son,&lt;br /&gt;
And give Him the glory, great things He hath done.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>This little light of mine</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This little light of mine, I’m gonna let it shine.&lt;br /&gt;
This little light of mine, I’m gonna let it shine,&lt;br /&gt;
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hide it under a bushel - NO!&lt;br /&gt;
I’m gonna let it shine,&lt;br /&gt;
Hide it under a bushel - NO!&lt;br /&gt;
I’m gonna let it shine,&lt;br /&gt;
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t let Satan blow it out.&lt;br /&gt;
I’m gonna let it shine&lt;br /&gt;
Don’t let Satan blow it out.&lt;br /&gt;
I’m gonna let it shine,&lt;br /&gt;
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This little light of mine, I’m gonna let it shine.&lt;br /&gt;
This little light of mine, I’m gonna let it shine,&lt;br /&gt;
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine.&lt;/p&gt;
